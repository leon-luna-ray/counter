# Counter

## Description

A simple counter app for counting just about anything!

Counter is built with React.js. The app allows the user to add or subtract 1 to the count and reset to 0.

### Features

- The count is saved in localstorage allowing the user to reload or leave the page without resetting the count.
- The reset button will prompt the user to confirm they want to reset.
